#### Sherry Cobbler

Replace the high-proof whiskey in an Old-Fashioned with a larger quantity of low-proof amontillado sherry, and swap muddled orange slices for the bitters, you have a Cobbler. Amontillado sherry is a fortified wine that gives the cocktail both body and acidity, making it a strong backbone for the drink. When muddled, the orange wheels add not only a touch of sweetness, but also some seasoning from the bitter pith in the skin. This complexity is nicely counterbalanced by the bright aroma of the fresh mint garnish.

When it comes to the garnish, don’t limit yourself to the orange wedge and mint called for here; an array of seasonal fruits is traditional, so play around with whatever fruits or herbs you have on hand.

#### Recipe

- 3 ounces dry amontillado Sherry
- 3/4 ounce simple syrup
- 1 orange wheel, plus ½ wheel for serving
- 1 lemon wheel, plus ½ wheel for serving
- Mint sprigs and a raspberry (for serving)

In a Collins glass, muddle the orange slice and syrup. Add the sherry and stir briefly. Top with crushed ice; cover; shake vigorously until outside is frosty, about 30 seconds. Top with more crushed ice, packing the glass fully. Garnish with the orange wedge and mint bouquet and serve with a straw.
